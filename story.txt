Hello, I'm Turbo the octopus. I live under lake Mendota and six inches of ice. It's very cold and dark
down here. I however, have night vision goggles that let me see through the darkness. Sometimes I come
across a beaming light that comes from above. I've always wondered what this could be.

One day, a sponge sinked into lake Mendota. I was curious about this newcomer. "Hey there, howdy!" I said.
The sponge waved at me. "My name is SpongeBob. People threw me into the lake because they freaked out
when they found me speaking to a crusty crab; then they threw me into the lake."

"Do you want to be friends?" I asked Spongebob.  "Yes!" he replied.  And so off we went, exploring the 
cold dark sea.  Sure enough, we encountered one of those mysterious light beams.  "Hey Spongebob, you're 
from the outside world, what on earth are those light beams?" I asked.  

"Those light beams are not even from the earth! They are from the Sun!" He said. I was really confused at this moment
since I have never heard the word "Sun". "What is that? is it something that we can eat?" I asked with curiousity.
"NOOO! It is a star at the center of the Solar System!" he replied. Similarly, I asked him what the Solar System is and
what is a star. He looked at me and said "You should take an astronomy class! Let's go to humans' world!"
