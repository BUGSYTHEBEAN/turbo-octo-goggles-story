Hello, I'm Turbo the octopus. I live under lake Mendota and six inches of ice. It's very cold and dark
down here. I however, have night vision goggles that let me see through the darkness. Sometimes I come
across a beaming light that comes from above. I've always wondered what this could be.

One day, a sponge sinked into lake Mendota. I was curious about this newcomer. "Hey there, howdy!" I said.
The sponge waved at me. "My name is SpongeBob. People threw me into the lake because they freaked out
when they found me speaking to a crusty crab; then they threw me into the lake."
